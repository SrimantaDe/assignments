## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

> Python code is simple as english language , it is readable and it is converted to machine 
level language using interpreter.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

> In Python the same variable can have a different type at different times during the execution.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

> pros : easy to learn, less code for same logic, huge library and community support
cons: takes more time to interpret so takes more time to execute.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

> web app, desktop app, data science, data analytics, mathematics, scientific research 

Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

> A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.
declaration : var_name= value

Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

> python_input= input()

Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

> string

Q8. What is type casting?

> To convert one data-type to another data-type.

Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

> We can take multiple inputs in one single line by using the raw_input function several times as shown below.
#multiple inputs in Python using input
x, y = input("Enter First Name: "), input("Enter Last Name: ") 

Q10. What are keywords?

> Keywords are restricted names that is used to declare deafult logics of the language.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

> No.
Interpreter will treat variables as keywords if we declare keywords as a variable.

Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

> Since python doesn't use any special brackets for loops and blocks so indentation is the rule to identify the start and end of logic by python interpreter.

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

> Using print() function.

Q14. What are operators in Python?

> Operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

> / is regular division(returns float) and // is floor division(returns int).

Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
>#1st way :
x="iNeuron"
a=""
for i in range(3) :
    a+=x
print(a)

#2nd way :
x="iNeuron"
p=lambda m : m+m+m
print(p(x))

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
>
x= int(input())
if x%2==0 :
    print("even")
else :
    print("odd")

Q18. What are boolean operator?

>Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0 > 1

0 and 0 > 0

True and False and True > False

1 or 0 or 0 > 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

> It  is used to handle conditions in the program.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

> used in conditional statements to build programing logic.

Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
>
age=int(input())
if age>=18 :
    print("I can vote")
else :
    print("I can't vote")

Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

```
>
from functools import reduce
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
evens=filter(lambda n : n%2==0, numbers)
sum=reduce(lambda a,b : a+b, evens)
print(sum)

Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
>
x,y,z=int(input()),int(input()),int(input())
if x>y :
    if(x>z):
        print(x," is greatest")
    else :
        print(z," is greatest")
else :
    if(y>z):
        print(y," is greatest")
    else :
        print(z," is greatest")

Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i>500 :
        break
    elif i>150 :
        continue
    elif i%5==0 :
        print(i)
